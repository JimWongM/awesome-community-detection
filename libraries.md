Nowadays, the analysis of dynamics in networks represents a great deal in the Social Network Analysis research area. To support students, teachers, developers, and researchers in this work we introduce a novel R package, namely DynComm. It is designed to be a multi-language package, that can be used for community detection and analysis on dynamic networks. The package introduces interfaces to facilitate further developments and the addition of new and future developed algorithms to deal with community detection in evolving networks. This new package has the goal of abstracting the programmatic interface of the algorithms, whether they are written in R or other languages, and expose them as functions in R.

Community Discovery is among the most studied problems in complex network analysis. During the last decade, many algorithms have been proposed to address such task; however, only a few of them have been integrated into a common framework, making it hard to use and compare different solutions. To support developers, researchers and practitioners, in this paper we introduce a python library - namely CDLIB - designed to serve this need. The aim of CDLIB is to allow easy and standardized access to a wide variety of network clustering algorithms, to evaluate and compare the results they provide, and to visualize them. It notably provides the largest available collection of community detection implementations, with a total of 39 algorithms.
